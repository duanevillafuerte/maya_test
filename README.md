# MAYA TEST

Maya exam written in Flutter by Duane Villafuerte.

## Notes
- Only developed with Android as platform
- Developed in Firebase Studio (Project IDX)
- Hastily done (time constraints), typos or missing tests may occur
- Spent around 15~ hours in development
- Some details of the exam are not clear so I used my judgement in order to move forward
- Sadly, not enough time to do Design documentations

## How to run
- Can run in Firebase Studio, or any local machine. As long as Flutter environment is installed properly
- Use `Maya` for username, `test` for password
- `flutter test` to run tests. Includes Unit tests & Widget tests. There are no Integration tests as it is out of scope
