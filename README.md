# MAYA TEST

Maya exam written in Flutter by Duane Villafuerte.

## Notes
- Only developed with Android as platform
- Developed in Firebase Studio (Project IDX)
- Done on short notice, typos or missing tests may occur
- Spent around 16~ hours in development
- Some details of the exam are not clear so I used my judgement in order to move forward
- Sadly, not enough time to do Design documentations

## How to run
- Can run in Firebase Studio, or any local machine. As long as Flutter environment is installed properly
- `flutter test` to run tests. Include Unit tests & Widget tests. There are no integration tests as it is out of scope
